# Rhenium

A compiler for a small statically-typed language that transpiles to C. This glossary fixes the
vocabulary the compiler and its documents use; the architecture it is built from lives in
[CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) and the language being designed lives in [docs/](./docs/README.md).

## Language

### The pipeline

**Decorate**:
To walk the AST and fill in each node's semantic context — resolving types, binding symbols, setting
the relevant scope. The AST is mutated in place; nothing is rebuilt.
_Avoid_: Annotate, analyze, type-check, resolve

**Decorator**:
A walker that decorates one kind of AST node.
_Avoid_: Visitor, analyzer, checker — `visitor` is reserved for the parse-tree walk that builds the
AST, and the two are different trees

**Transpiler**:
An emitter that reads one kind of decorated AST node and writes C to an output stream.
_Avoid_: Generator, codegen, backend, compiler

### Errors

**Diagnostic**:
A message about something the user got wrong, carrying a line, a column and text. Diagnostics are
values that are returned and accumulated, never thrown; a thrown exception is a compiler bug rather
than bad input.
_Avoid_: Error, warning, exception, failure

**Poison type**:
`InvalidType` — the type a failed expression takes. It absorbs every operation and assignment so that
one mistake produces one diagnostic instead of a cascade of consequences.
_Avoid_: Error type, unknown type, any, bottom type

**Poisoned**:
Of a declaration or symbol: still present and still bound, but carrying the poison type because the
thing that would have given it a real type failed. A poisoned declaration is what lets the rest of
the program keep being analyzed.
_Avoid_: Failed, invalid, broken, unresolved

### Types and values

**Expression type**:
The type of a value, as resolved by the semantic analyzer. Every one of them knows the C spelling it
is emitted as, which implicit conversions it permits, and which casts it permits.
_Avoid_: Type annotation, data type, kind

**C name**:
The text an expression type is emitted as in C.
_Avoid_: Native name, mapped type, C type

**Printable type**:
An expression type that a value can be printed as, which is every type except the poison type.
_Avoid_: Displayable, formattable, showable

**Mangled name**:
The unique C identifier a variable is emitted as, derived from its source name so that C never sees
two declarations collide across scopes it does not have.
_Avoid_: Unique name, generated name, symbol name

### Scopes and symbols

**Symbol**:
A named thing a scope can resolve — a variable or a type.
_Avoid_: Binding, entry, definition

**Left value**:
A symbol that can appear on the left of an assignment. Types are symbols but are not left values.
_Avoid_: LHS, assignable, target, variable reference

**Global scope**:
The outermost scope, seeded with the primitive types before any source is analyzed.
_Avoid_: Root scope, builtin scope, prelude
